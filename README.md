Third person roll-a-ball game

I started this project with my college friend @naidaagic. We are hoping that we can get it done by next summer. We have gained a lot of experience working on this project. Unity is a great engine if you want to make a simple game. Most of our knowledge about Unity came from youtube tutorials and the Monobehaviour Unity library. Prior to this project, we had experience in programming with C++/C, so we just applied our knowledge on C# in Unity. We still have a lot of work ahead of us but we solved some major issues like moving the ball and the camera, the storyline, physics, U-I but we are still working on designing the levels, improving performances and so on. Through this project we are also gaining experiece with 3D modeling in Blender and designing our own textures in Photoshop.
