Third person roll-a-ball game

I started this project with my college friend. We are hoping we can get it done by next summer. We gathered a lot of experience working on this project. Unity is a great engine if you want a simple game. We learned all from youtube tutorials and Monobehaviour Unity library. All experience we had was from c++, so we just converted our knowledge into c# in Unity. We still have a lot to be done but we solved some major issues like moving the ball and the camera, storyline, physics, U-I but we will work on designing the levels, improving performances and so on.
